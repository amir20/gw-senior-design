        <p><strong>I get the following error when trying to execute Voice Launch? </strong></p>
        <p align="center"><img width="228" height="103" src="img/trouble_clip_image002.jpg"></p>
        <p>This error is caused when the host machine does not have Java JRE 1.5 or later installed correctly. The latest version of Java JRE can be obtained from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com</a><br>

        <p><strong>My microphone does not record any voice? What is going on? </strong></p>
        <p>Step 1) Make sure that the microphone is properly connected to the computer.</p>
        <p>Step 2) Make sure the microphone is not set to mute. </p>
        <p>Step 3) The Java Virtual Machine records from the selected device under Windows Recording Option. Please refer to installation page on how to setup Windows Recording Options. </p>
        <p><strong><br>
        I cannot launch any application using the hotkey feature? </strong></p>
        <p>If for some reason there is another application running which uses the same combination of hotkeys, then there is possibility that application might have overridden Voice Launch&rsquo;s hotkey settings. Try closing all other applications and restarting Voice Launch.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Can I backup my library? </strong></p>
        <p>Yes, go to Voice Launch&rsquo;s installation directory (by default it is C:\Program File\Voice Launch) and look for the &lsquo;Classes&rsquo; folder. Under Classes folder, there is another folder called &lsquo;user&rsquo;. That folder contains all the data that has been saved. Make a copy of that folder to create a backup of your data.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>How do I open Voice Launch window once I have hidden it? </strong></p>
        <p>Right click on the system tray icon and choose Open Voice Launch.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>The Continuous Recording does not work for me? </strong></p>
        <p>Continuous Recording was created as a test and was not expected to have very high accuracy. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done to improve the accuracy.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Can I distribute Voice Launch to my friends? </strong></p>
        <p>Yes, certainly. </p>
        <p>However, THIS APPLICATION SHALL NOT BE SOLD TO ANYBODY FOR ANY PRICE, and all credits must be given to Amir Raminfar. </p> </td>
