      There are two methods to add new items to the library. Choose “Insert New Application to Library” in the Library menu as shown in Figure 7 or click the first icon from the left on the toolbar.  <br>

		  After performing either of these methods, a similar window as shown in Figure 8 is displayed. In this window, the user is required to first record a two-second phrase. This phrase file will later be associated with the application to be launched. To record the phrase, click Record and wait for the progress bar to be displayed. After the recording, the phrase can be previewed by clicking Preview. <br>

Also try to remember the distance between the microphone and your mouth. This distance should be the same every time.
